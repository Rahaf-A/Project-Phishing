            <p>Spear Phishing </p>
        </div>
        <div class="subtext">
            <p>This type occurs when the attacker already knows some information about a specific person and uses that information to seem more legitimate. This type is the most successful since it has information and context relating to the target which makes the target believe it’s true.</p>

            <p> Whaling</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subtext">
            <p>Spear phishing's subtype of whaling is typically even more precise. The distinction is that whaling targets specific people like high-ranking business executives, famous people, and wealthy people. These high-value targets' account credentials typically open the door to more information and possibly money.</p>
