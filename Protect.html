        <p class="maincontenttext textpadding">Many people are aware of scams and how damaging they could be to people’s lives, but many are not fully aware of how common and how more believable scams have gotten in the past few years as technology advances and become more accessible to everyone. Below are five ways to protect yourself from phishing.</p>

   <div class="exbox">
        <div class="subtitle">
            <p>Check the email address</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subtext">
            <p>Examining the sender's address can help you identify emails that might be phishing attempts. Email phishers frequently fail to mimic a real address and rely on readers not to notice. The address might be a collection of random characters rather than the real name of the business. Send an email from an unfamiliar address to the Federal Trade Commission. </p>

        <div class="subtitle">
            <p>Don’t Click</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subtext">
            <p> Never click on an email link unless you were anticipating it. Go directly to the website rather than clicking a link if an email claiming to be from your bank or a money management website like PayPal is received. Official websites will probably ask you to complete this anyway.</p>

        <div class="subtitle">
            <p>Avoid Panicking</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subtext">
            <p>Pop-ups, in addition to emails, are a typical technique for enticing you to click on links or enter information. Messages such as "A security breach has been detected on your computer. For safety, click here!" are tempting but clicking there frequently leads to a harmful website or downloads a virus.</p>

    <div class="exbox">

            <p>Don't Fall for Big Prizes</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subtext">
            <p>Large prizes, such as free gift cards for online shopping, are another way con artists like to get your attention. If these emails and pop-ups appear to be from a store you frequently visit, they may even catch your attention. Do not click, though, regardless of the source. Online, the word "free" always implies risk, so beware.</p>

        <div class="subtext">
            <p>Install a phishing filter in both your web browser and email program to safeguard yourself against future attacks. Additionally, make sure your device has security software. Even though these precautions won't completely prevent phishing, they will lessen attempts.</p>
